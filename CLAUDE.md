# cloudgov — development brief

AWS security and cost swiss army knife CLI. Written in Go 1.26.
Module: `github.com/nanohype/cloudgov`
Build: `task build`

## project goal

Production-quality open-source CLI for public release on GitHub.
Target users: platform engineers, security engineers, DevOps teams.
Differentiator: single binary, AWS-native, five domains spanning IAM, cost, infrastructure hygiene, security posture, and operational visibility. A Kubernetes RBAC scanner (`cloudgov k8s rbac`) rounds out the cluster side.

## commands

**IAM**
- `cloudgov iam scan` — unused/overprivileged IAM permissions vs CloudTrail/Audit Logs
- `cloudgov iam fix` — generate Terraform fix files from scan report

**Cost**
- `cloudgov cost diff` — spend delta between two time windows

**Infrastructure hygiene**
- `cloudgov orphans` — unused disks, IPs, load balancers
- `cloudgov storage audit` — public buckets, unencrypted storage, versioning, logging
- `cloudgov network audit` — overly permissive security groups
- `cloudgov certs` — TLS certificates expiring within configurable thresholds
- `cloudgov tags` — resources missing required tags/labels

**Security posture**
- `cloudgov secrets scan` — credential/key leakage in code, env, storage
- `cloudgov compliance` — map findings to benchmarks (CIS, etc.) from a scan report
- `cloudgov drift` — live cloud state vs Terraform state
- `cloudgov audit` — orchestrates all the above into one consolidated run

**Operational visibility & workflow**
- `cloudgov inventory` — list all AWS resources
- `cloudgov quota` — service quota utilization vs limits
- `cloudgov baseline` — save/list/delete named scan baselines
- `cloudgov compare` — diff a current report against a saved baseline
- `cloudgov report` — generate HTML report from a JSON scan output

## code conventions

- Idiomatic Go. No magic. Keep packages small and focused.
- Errors: wrap with `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`. Never swallow.
- All cloud API calls must be context-aware.
- Table output via lipgloss + tabwriter. No bubbletea (no interactive TUI needed).
- No global state. No init() side effects beyond cobra command registration.
- `task build` must always pass before marking any backlog item complete.
- `go test ./...` must always pass (no failing tests).

## import aliases (use these consistently)

```go
awssdk   "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws"
cloudaws "github.com/nanohype/cloudgov/internal/cloud/aws"
cloudk8s "github.com/nanohype/cloudgov/internal/cloud/k8s"
orphanscanner "github.com/nanohype/cloudgov/internal/orphans"
```

## guardrails — do not do these

- Do not refactor, rename, or clean up code that is not directly required by the current backlog item.
- Do not add new external dependencies unless the backlog item explicitly requires one and nothing in stdlib or existing deps works.
- Do not change any public interface (Provider, IAMProvider, CostProvider, etc.) without updating every implementation and every call site.
- Do not add comments or docstrings to functions you didn't modify.
- Do not add features, flags, or options that aren't in the current backlog item, even if they seem useful.
- Do not split one backlog item into multiple commits or partial implementations. Each item must be complete and working before marking [x].
- Do not mark an item [x] if `task build` or `go test ./...` fails.

## what "done" means for a backlog item

1. The feature/fix/file described in the item is fully implemented.
2. `task build` exits 0.
3. `go test ./...` exits 0 with no skipped tests related to the item.
4. No regressions in packages not mentioned in the backlog item.

## recovery — if the build breaks mid-pass

1. Read the error output carefully.
2. Fix only what the error points to — do not rewrite the surrounding code.
3. If a dependency or type doesn't exist, check the actual module in `~/go/pkg/mod` before guessing alternatives.
4. If stuck after two fix attempts, revert the failing file to its last working state and add a note to the backlog item instead of marking it [x].

## mock pattern for tests

All tests must run with `go test ./...` and no cloud credentials. Use interface mocks:

```go
// implement only the methods needed for the test
type mockOrphansProvider struct {
    orphans []cloud.OrphanResource
    err     error
}
func (m *mockOrphansProvider) Name() string { return "mock" }
func (m *mockOrphansProvider) Detect(_ context.Context) bool { return true }
func (m *mockOrphansProvider) ListOrphans(_ context.Context) ([]cloud.OrphanResource, error) {
    return m.orphans, m.err
}
```

Do not use `gomock`, `testify/mock`, or any mock-generation library. Hand-written mocks only.

## known bugs in the current code

(none currently outstanding — the three previous bugs are fixed and verified)

## backlog

Work through these in order. Mark items `[x]` when done.
When all items in a section are done, move to the next section.

### section 1 — tests (required for public release)

- [x] `internal/iam/analyzer_test.go` — unit tests for `analyze()`: admin action detection, wildcard resource, unused permission, stale principal, cross-account, dedup. Use table-driven tests with mock principals and permissions.
- [x] `internal/iam/suggest_test.go` — test `BuildMinimalPermissions` and `GroupByResource`
- [x] `internal/fix/terraform_test.go` — test `formatAWSTF`, `slug`
- [x] `internal/output/json_test.go` — test JSON marshaling round-trips for all report types
- [x] `internal/orphans/scanner_test.go` — test `Scan` with a mock provider, `TotalMonthlyCost`
- [x] `internal/storage/scanner_test.go` — test `Scan` with a mock provider, severity filtering

### section 2 — robustness

- [x] Add concurrency to `iam.Scan`: scan principals in parallel with `errgroup`, cap goroutines at 10. Add `--concurrency` flag to `iam scan`.
- [x] Add exponential backoff retry wrapper for all AWS API calls (use `aws-sdk-go-v2`'s built-in retry with `RetryMaxAttempts: 5`).
- [x] Handle AWS paginator errors gracefully — log warning and continue rather than aborting the whole scan.
- [x] `internal/cloud/aws/iam.go`: handle `NoSuchEntity` errors when fetching individual policy versions (policy may have been deleted between list and get).
- [x] `cmd/iam.go` `runIAMFix`: currently generates empty policies. Fix: load used permissions from the scan report JSON (not by re-querying the API) and pass them to `MinimalPolicy`.

### section 3 — user experience

- [x] Add `--version` output that includes build date and git commit hash (already have Version ldflags, add `BuildDate` and `Commit` vars, set in Taskfile).
- [x] Add progress output to stderr during long scans: "scanning aws: 12/47 principals..." using a simple counter, not a spinner.
- [x] `cloudgov iam scan` table output: add a summary line at the bottom: "X critical, Y high, Z medium across N principals".
- [x] `cloudgov orphans` table: add a TOTAL row at the bottom showing sum of monthly cost.
- [x] Add `--quiet` flag to root command that suppresses all stderr progress/summary output (for use in scripts).
- [x] Color-code the cost diff table: red for cost increases >10%, green for decreases.

### section 4 — distribution

- [x] Write `.goreleaser.yaml`: build for linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64, windows/amd64. Include checksums. Use ldflags for version/commit/date.
- [x] Write `.github/workflows/release.yml`: trigger on tag push `v*`, run goreleaser.
- [x] Write `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: on push/PR — `go build ./...`, `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`.
- [x] Write `README.md`: installation (brew tap + go install + direct download), quickstart for each command, credentials setup for each provider, CI usage example (SARIF output), screenshot placeholder.
- [x] Write `CONTRIBUTING.md`: how to add a new provider, how to add a new command group, test requirements.

### section 5 — completeness

- [x] `cloudgov iam scan --output sarif`: currently only works for IAM findings. Route storage findings through SARIF too (add `WriteStorageSARIF` to output package).
- [x] Add `cloudgov storage audit --fix`: generate remediation scripts (shell, not Terraform) for each finding. Write to `--out` directory.
- [x] Add `cloudgov cost diff --threshold 20` flag: only show services with >20% change.
- [x] Add `--profile` flag to `iam scan` for AWS named profiles (pass through to `config.LoadDefaultConfig` with `config.WithSharedConfigProfile`).

### section 6 — coverage (Phase 2 of maintenance plan)

Goal: get `internal/cloud/{aws,k8s}` from 0% to meaningful coverage by extracting per-domain SDK interfaces and injecting them. Reference pattern: `internal/orphans/scanner_test.go:11-22`.

- [ ] `internal/cloud/aws/iam.go` — extract narrow `iamAPI` interface, hold it on `Provider`, add `aws/iam_test.go` with hand-written mock. This is the reference implementation; update this section with the proven pattern before fanning out.
- [ ] Repeat for every file in `internal/cloud/aws/` (cloudtrail, cost, orphans, storage, network, certs, tags, drift, inventory, quota, secrets).
- [ ] Repeat for `internal/cloud/k8s/` (rbac).
- [ ] `internal/output/table.go` — add `table_test.go` with golden-file tests for each report renderer under `testdata/*.golden`.
- [ ] `internal/output/sarif.go` — add `sarif_test.go` for SARIF round-trip.
- [ ] `internal/cloud/provider_test.go` — small unit test for `SeverityRank` and constant tables.
- [ ] `internal/config/*_test.go` — add tests for configuration loading.
- [ ] `internal/cost/*_test.go` — add tests for cost-domain logic.
- [ ] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — add `-cover -coverprofile=coverage.out`, add a coverage floor check (start 50%, ratchet up), add `golangci-lint run`.

### section 7 — uplift (production-grade AWS + pluggable multi-cloud seam)

Dependency-ordered. Stay **AWS-only**; keep the seams **pluggable** so a future GCP/Azure
provider is additive (implement the `cloud` capability interfaces + register a factory). Do
each item completely; `task build` + `go test ./...` green before marking `[x]`.

- [x] **Provider registry** (`internal/providers`): collapse the per-command `resolveXProviders` + `buildAuditProviders` into one `Factory{Name,Detect,New}` + `Registry` with generic `Resolve[T]`/`Capable[T]`. Adding a cloud becomes "implement + register in `Default`" with no command changes (proven by `registry_test.go`). No global state — `Default()` is a constructor.
- [x] **Resolver/flag correctness**: `iam fix` gains `--profile` and passes it (was hardcoded `""` — silent multi-account bug); a root `PersistentPreRun` resets `exitCode`/`failOn`/`quiet` run-state so the command tree is safe to re-drive in one process (MCP/agent loops) — flags reset only when not explicitly passed. The registry already supplies the provider-agnostic "no cloud provider detected" message.
- [x] **Thread `--quiet` to provider warnings**: the 18 unconditional `os.Stderr` warn spots across `internal/cloud/aws/{iam,cloudtrail,quota,orphans}.go` now go through a `p.warnf` helper backed by a `warnw io.Writer` (os.Stderr by default; `cloudaws.WithQuiet` routes it to `io.Discard`). Threaded via `providers.WithQuiet` through every resolver + `buildAuditProviders` + the `platform` command, all fed by the root `--quiet` flag.
- [x] **Valid-HCL fix generator**: `formatAWSTF` emitted `jsonencode(<raw policy JSON>)`. The real defect wasn't object syntax (HCL2 accepts JSON-style `{"k": v}`) — it was that Terraform **interpolated IAM policy variables** (`${aws:username}` → "Extra characters after interpolation expression") and rejected JSON escapes HCL doesn't accept (`\/`, `\b`). Now emits the policy as a literal heredoc (backslashes stay literal) with `${`/`%{` escaped so policy variables survive verbatim. Proven by a `tofu fmt` parse test over a `${aws:username}` policy (skips without tofu) + an escaping unit test; spot-checked with `tofu validate`.
- [x] **Real Service Quotas + honest orphan cost**: `quota.go` now reads the applied EC2/VPC/S3/RDS limits via a `p.quotaLimit(serviceCode, quotaCode, fallback)` helper (`servicequotas:GetServiceQuota`) instead of hardcoded defaults — fixes false near-limit alarms for accounts that raised limits; any unknown code / denied call / nil client falls back to the old default (strictly no-worse). Quota codes verified against AWS docs (EIP `L-0263D0A3`, VPC `L-F678F1CE`, IGW `L-A4707A72`, RDS `L-7B6409FD`; SG `L-E79EC296`, S3 `L-DC2B2D3D` are best-effort + fallback-protected). orphan `Detail` strings now flag the cost as an on-demand list-price estimate (README caveat added); the Pricing API stays deferred. `quotaLimit` mock-tested (applied value vs fallback).
- [x] **Cluster-residue orphans**: `internal/cloud/aws/cluster_residue.go` adds `orphanClusterResidue()` — EKS `/aws/eks/<cluster>/cluster` log groups (logs), `Karpenter-<cluster>` SQS (sqs), `Karpenter*` EventBridge rules (eventbridge; `ClusterName` tag, missing-tag = failed-create debris), all matched against live `eks:ListClusters` so a live cluster is never flagged; liveness-unknown skips the scan. New `OrphanKind`s + a `Kind.AlwaysReport()` so the `scanner.go` min-cost filter can't hide the ~$0 conflict residue. Mock-tested (live skipped / dead flagged / untagged debris). Adds eks/cloudwatchlogs/sqs/eventbridge clients. **NOTE:** this is DETECTION only; `eks-fleet/scripts/reap-orphans.sh` is fully retired to a pointer once remediate (item 6) gives orphans a delete path.
- [x] **Wire remediate for the runnable-remediation domains**: `cmd/remediate.go` emits orphan DELETE scripts (`--type orphans`, `internal/orphans/fix.go`) alongside storage/network, synthesizing each delete from the resource's kind+id — EBS `delete-volume`, EIP `release-address`, ELB `delete-load-balancer`, EKS log group `delete-log-group`, Karpenter SQS `delete-queue`, and the Karpenter EventBridge rule's two-step name-keyed teardown (list-targets → remove-targets → delete-rule) — skipping any kind with no single-command delete or an empty id. Output is deterministic (no embedded timestamp) and diff-before-write (an identical script on disk is left untouched, so re-runs are idempotent). Empirically the other audit domains aren't shell-remediable: iam/secrets `Remediation` strings are prose (iam routes through `iam fix`'s Terraform), and certs/tags carry no per-finding remediation — so remediate's contract ("emit shell scripts that remediate each finding") covers exactly storage, network, orphans, and the help text says so. This gives orphans the delete path that retires `eks-fleet/scripts/reap-orphans.sh` to a pointer (an eks-fleet change).
- **In-domain gaps** (split into ordered sub-items):
  - [x] **7a — dead `OrphanSnapshot`/`OrphanImage`**: `orphans.go` scans both (extends `ec2API` with `DescribeSnapshots`/`DescribeImages`). Snapshots: self-owned EBS snapshots stranded by AMI deregistration — flagged only when the snapshot's AWS-generated description (`Created by CreateImage(…) for ami-XXXX …`) names an AMI no longer in `DescribeImages(Owners=self)` and no live AMI references it; manual/backup snapshots (no such description) are never flagged (low false-positive). AMIs: self-owned images not referenced by any instance's `ImageId`, framed in `Detail` as a review signal (AMIs kept for future launches also match). Cost = backing GiB × $0.05/mo snapshot list price. Both are first-class through remediate (`delete-snapshot` / `deregister-image` — deregister leaves snapshots, which the next scan flags). Mock-tested; the new kinds carry real cost so they respect `--min-cost` (not `AlwaysReport`).
  - [x] **7b — `DriftResult` normalization**: `compare/normalize.go` gains a `ReportTypeDrift` (detected by the `results` envelope key) and `normalizeDrift`/`normalizeDriftResult`, so `cloudgov compare` (and `report`) handle drift reports instead of erroring "unknown report type". Each `DriftResult` maps to a `NormalizedFinding` keyed on the Terraform address (`resource_name`, falling back to the cloud id), `Type` = the drift status, `Detail` = the result's detail or a summary of the drifted field names, and severity ranked DELETED→HIGH / MODIFIED→MEDIUM / ERROR→LOW. `IN_SYNC` results are skipped (absence of drift isn't a finding). Mock-tested (status mapping, IN_SYNC exclusion, tf-address keying, field summary).
  - [x] **7c — tags coverage**: `AuditTags` now also checks ECS clusters, EKS clusters, DynamoDB tables, SNS topics, and SQS queues for missing required tags (was EC2/S3/RDS/Lambda only). New `dynamodbAPI`/`snsAPI` narrow interfaces + `dynamodb`/`sns` clients; `eksAPI` gained `DescribeCluster` and `sqsAPI` gained `ListQueueTags` (extended in place); ECS reuses the existing `ecsAPI` via `DescribeClusters` with `include=TAGS`. Each auditor paginates, derives the resource name (ARN/URL tail), and nil-guards its client so partial test construction doesn't panic. Mock-tested per service. README least-privilege policy + the tags section updated with the new resource types and read/tag IAM actions.
  - [x] **7d — certs SARIF + Days**: `output.WriteCertsSARIF` + `buildCertRules` (rule id = cert status, level follows severity) wired as `cloudgov certs --output sarif`. `opts.Days` is now authoritative: `ListCertificates` dropped its hardcoded `>180` cap so the certs scanner's `--days` filter is the single window gate (cmd + audit both pass it, default 90) — `--days 365` now surfaces certs expiring in 181+ days, no change at the default. README certs flags table + a SARIF usage example added. Verified by an adversarial review workflow (both correctness dimensions clean; confirmed doc/test-parity nits fixed: README `--output` row, `buildCertRules` in the `TestBuildRules_NonEmpty` map, and `TestWriteCertsSARIF` now asserts the driver rules table levels).
- [x] **Honest AWS-only + parity matrix**: an audit workflow found the headline was already AWS-honest; the real overclaims were a handful of command help strings using generic "cloud"/"across providers" (`inventory`, `quota`, `secrets`/`secrets scan` which falsely listed GCP "Cloud Functions" + Azure "App Service" as scan targets, plus `cost`/`orphans`/`drift`). All rewritten to name AWS. README gains a `## Cloud support` section + a command×cloud parity matrix (✅ implemented / ⬡ seam-ready / — n/a): AWS full across all domains, GCP/Azure seam-ready (capability interfaces exist, no provider), k8s for RBAC; offline + `mcp` commands noted as cloud-agnostic. The pluggable-seam framing (the intentional design) is kept; only present-tense multi-cloud claims were removed. Verified by an adversarial review workflow (no overclaim survived, every matrix row accurate; fixed its 4 LOW nits — inventory/drift H3 headings, the cost/orphans/drift Shorts, the Platform footnote which had said "RBAC" instead of IRSA + tenant cluster objects, and `mcp` missing from the matrix note).
- **Output renderer cleanup** (split into ordered sub-items):
  - [x] **9a — Severity on domain structs**: `cloud.QuotaUsage` gains a `Severity` field (`json:"severity"`), set at construction in the AWS provider's `ListQuotas` (derived from utilization). All readers — `output.WriteQuotas`, `quota.Summarize`, `compare.normalizeQuotas`, and the `report` HTML generator — now read it via a `QuotaUsage.EffectiveSeverity()` accessor that falls back to computing from `Utilization` when unset (back-compat for reports saved before the field + hand-built test data). QuotaUsage was the one struct recomputing severity per-reader; the other findingless structs (OrphanResource/CostDiff/InventoryResource) carry no severity by nature. Mock-tested; verified all read sites converted by grep.
  - [x] **9b — split the monolithic renderer files**: the 715-line `output/table.go` + 252-line `output/json.go` are split into per-domain files — `output/<domain>.go` (iam, storage, orphans, cost, network, certs, tags, drift, compliance, lambda, k8s, secrets, audit, inventory, quota, compare, platform) each owns that domain's table renderer + JSON report struct + writer; shared infra lives in `style.go` (lipgloss styles, `colorSeverity`, `formatTags`, `truncate`) and `jsoncore.go` (`writeJSON`). Adding a domain now adds one file instead of editing two shared monoliths. (`sarif.go` left cohesive as the SARIF concern.) Pure move — verified behavior-preserving by line-conservation (869 code lines in == 869 out, sorted-identical) plus the unchanged `output` test suite (table/json/sarif) passing. The original "runtime `FindingRenderer` registry" was reframed after empirical review: commands dispatch type-specifically (compile-time-safe), renderers have heterogeneous signatures (IAM principal counts, audit `*Report`, compare `CompareResult`), and the one generic consumer (`report`) already routes through `compare.NormalizeReport`, so a uniform `any`-typed registry would trade type safety for indirection with no caller that needs it.
- [x] **Integration tests + CI floors**: `internal/integration` runs provider→scanner→output end-to-end — a fixture provider registered through the real `providers.NewRegistry`/`Capable`, resolved by capability, run through each domain scanner, rendered to JSON+table, asserting multiple fields per domain + a severity-filter-discriminates case (the cmd `RunE` shell resolves via `Default()` and is intentionally un-injectable, so the cobra layer is covered by `cmd` unit tests). Writing the `cmd` helper tests (`cmd/remediate_test.go`) surfaced + fixed a latent bug: remediate's bare-array fallback was unreachable (a bare array errored the envelope unmarshal before the fallback ran). `.coverage-floors` (per-package floors, ratcheting) enforced by `scripts/coverage.sh` in `ci.yml` — fails on below-floor, on a floored package with no coverage line (stale name), and on a tested package with no floor (ungated new code); `golangci-lint` + coverage profiling were already in CI. Verified by an adversarial review workflow (12 findings; bugfix + floor logic verified correct, the rest — honest seam labeling, multi-field assertions, filter discrimination, the two new floor guards, bugfix edge-case tests — addressed).

## how to run a single improvement pass (headless)

```bash
claude --print "Read CLAUDE.md. Find the first unchecked [ ] backlog item. Implement it fully. Mark it [x] when done. Run task build to verify it compiles. Run go test ./... to verify tests pass."
```

## release checklist

Before tagging v1.0.0:
- All section 1-4 backlog items marked [x]
- `task build` passes
- `go test ./...` passes with >80% coverage on analyzer package
- README has real screenshots
- goreleaser dry-run succeeds (`goreleaser release --snapshot --clean`)
